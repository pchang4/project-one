                <p>Muhammad Ali born Cassius Marcellus Clay, January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer, activist, and philanthropist. 
                    He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was 
                    known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside of the ring. He was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, 
                    and began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old. At age 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 
                    Summer Olympics in Rome, then turned professional later that year, before converting to Islam after 1961. At age 22, in 1964, he won the world 
                    heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset. He then changed his name from Cassius Clay, which he called his "slave name", to 
                    Muhammad Ali. He set an example of racial pride for African Americans and resistance to white domination during the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
